## How it works

My project uses a 10kHz signal, which is slowed down by D-Flip Flops
I hold the current state in D-Flip FLops and use logic gates to determine the
next state.

## How to test

I connected 3 LEDs to the output to test if the lit up at the right time, and in te right order.

## External hardware

I used 3 LEDs to test if the lights lit up at the right timw, and in the right order.
