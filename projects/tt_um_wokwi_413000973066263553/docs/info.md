## How it works

Full Adder : 
In0, In1, In2 are inputs to the full adder ( A, B and C )
Out0 and Out1 are outputs ( SFA and CFA )
SFA = C XOR ( A XOR B) 
CFA = (A OR B) AND (C OR (A XOR B))   AB=


1 bit comparator 
In3and In4. 
Out2, out3 and out 4. ( lesser, equal and greater )

Half Adder
In5 and In6 ( A, B ), Out 5 and out 6 ( HAS and HAC )

## How to test

Connect inputs signals and add LED's to check output

## External hardware

LED display and resistors
